In Java interviews, several exceptions and exception-related scenarios are commonly discussed. Here are some famous ones:

1. **`NullPointerException`**: Occurs when trying to use an object reference that has not been initialized or is null.

2. **`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`**: Thrown when trying to access an array with an illegal index (either negative or greater than the size of the array).

3. **`ArithmeticException`**: Raised for mathematical errors, such as division by zero.

4. **`ClassCastException`**: Occurs when trying to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance.

5. **`NumberFormatException`**: Thrown when attempting to convert a string to a numeric type, but the string is not a valid representation of a number.

6. **`IOException`**: A general exception for input/output operations, such as file handling. Specific subclasses include `FileNotFoundException` and `EOFException`.

7. **`FileNotFoundException`**: A subclass of `IOException`, thrown when trying to access a file that does not exist.

8. **`SQLException`**: Occurs during database access errors or other SQL issues.

9. **`IllegalArgumentException`**: Raised when a method receives an argument that is inappropriate or out of expected range.

10. **`IllegalStateException`**: Thrown when a method is invoked at an inappropriate time or in an inappropriate state.

11. **`UnsupportedOperationException`**: Indicates that a particular method or operation is not supported by the implementation.

12. **`StackOverflowError`**: Thrown when a stack overflow occurs, usually due to excessive recursion.

13. **`OutOfMemoryError`**: Indicates that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has run out of memory and cannot allocate more objects.

14. **`NoSuchMethodException`**: Thrown when attempting to access a method that does not exist.

15. **`NoSuchFieldException`**: Raised when a particular field is not found.

Understanding these exceptions and knowing how to handle or avoid them is crucial for writing robust Java code and can often be a topic of discussion in technical interviews.
